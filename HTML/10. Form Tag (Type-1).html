    In this case, the text "Enter Name:" is just plain text that appears before the input field.
    While users can still interact with the input field, there are a few drawbacks:

    1. No Clickable Area: The text "Enter Name:" itself is not directly associated with the input field.
    Users cannot click on the label text to focus on or activate the input field.

    2. Accessibility: Screen readers won't necessarily associate the text "Enter Name:" with the input field,
    potentially leading to confusion for users relying on screen readers.
    -->

    Enter Name: <input type ="text" name=" " placeholder="Enter Name">

    <label for = "N">Enter Name: </label>
    <input id = "N" type ="text" name=" " placeholder="Enter Name">
    <input type ="submit" value="Login">
    
    <!--
    Using the <label> tag improves accessibility, usability, and user experience by creating a clear connection between the label text and the input field,
    providing a clickable area, and enhancing the overall clarity of the form. 
    -->
